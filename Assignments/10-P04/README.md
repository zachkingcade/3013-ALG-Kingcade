## Program 04 - Graph Connectivity
#### Due: 04-05-2020 (Sunday @ 11:59 p.m.)

>**NOTE:** We are going to solve 2-3 of these UVA problems a week. I'm giving this a due date of Sunday night by midnight, but I will be posting at least one more this week (depending on their difficulty) which will also have a due date of Sunday midnight.

### Overview

Look at [CP3](https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/cp3.pdf) section on graph traversal: 4.2 Graph Traversal and complete the [UVA problem 459](459.pdf) which finds connected components in graphs.

We discussed graph traversals in class before we were banned, and I also went over the code provided by  [CP3](https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/cp3.pdf) that dealt with representing graphs using an adjacency list. [HERE](../../RESOURCES/../Lectures/07-Graphs/traversals.cpp) is the code we went over in class which should help you solve this problem. Problem 459 is directly discussed in the book in 4.2.3 so their shouldn't be too many issues 

### Deliverables

- Make sure your UVA username is on this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ShN0rIHHMi8mdyPhNDfehTJcw3GRApJPUboiSi2mBxA/edit?usp=sharing) version of our class roster.
- Create a folder called 459 in your `assignments` folder.
- Call your program `main.cpp` 
- Include all input files you used to test your code with. 
- Include the pdf of the problem in your `459` folder as well. 
- Upload to UVA online judge by due date.
- Upload to github soon after (not before).
