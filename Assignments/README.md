| Folder Name | Description |
|:-----------|:-------------|
|xx-**A**xx | This is some kind of an ***Assignment***, where an `assignment` can be anything that isn't big enough to be a full fledged program, and not specific enough to be a homework. |
|xx-**H**xx | This is a ***Homework***. Something pretty specific, usually not requiring a lot of programming. |
|xx-**P**xx | This is a ***Program***. Where is must be compile, run error free, commented, and correct. |
|xx-**T**xx | This is a ***Test***. Usually when on github, it will start out as a study guide, then get accompanied with a solution after the exam. |

## Student
This is my work for the 3013 Algorithms class at Midwestern State University under [Doctor Griffin](https://github.com/rugbyprof). This template is a near match to his format used for delivery of work to the class
however since it is on the students end due to stuff like cancelled assignments or changed work the table may look incomplete or have gaps in the lists numbers.
